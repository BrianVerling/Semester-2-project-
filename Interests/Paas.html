                <h3>About:</h3>
                
                <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those needed for application development -- to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. </p>
                
                <h3>Benefits:</h3>
                <p>Convenience:The PaaS provider supplies much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can access anywhere via a web browser.</p>
                <p>Cost:The PaaS providers then charge for that access on a per-use basis -- a model that many enterprises prefer, as it eliminates the capital expenses they traditionally have for on-premises hardware and software.</p>
