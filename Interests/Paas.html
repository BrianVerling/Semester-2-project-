                <h2>About:</h2>
                
                <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those needed for application development -- to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. </p>
                
                <h3>Benefits:</h3>
                <p>Convenience: The PaaS provider supplies much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can access anywhere via a web browser.</p>
                <p>Cost: The PaaS providers then charge for that access on a per-use basis -- a model that many enterprises prefer, as it eliminates the capital expenses they traditionally have for on-premises hardware and software.Some PaaS providers charge a flat monthly fee to access their service, as well as the apps hosted within it.</p>
                <p>Dynamic Allocaion: In today’s competitive market, IT teams need to have the flexibility to quickly test and put a new feature of an application or a new service on the market; or test these on a small section of clients before making them available to the entire world. With PaaS and cloud computing, such tasks have now become possible.</p>
                
                <h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
                <p>Security: As with other cloud computing solutions, many companies still have low confidence in the level of data security offered by PaaS. Many businesses are still skeptical about having their applications hosted by a third party, while some enterprises and government clients need to be assured of compliance with all applicable regulations concerning security, privacy, and data retention before they decide in favor of PaaS services.</p>
                <p>Limited Flexibility: PaaS solutions can’t match the flexibility of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) offerings. Unlike their IaaS counterparts, PaaS customers cannot necessarily create and delete multiple virtual machines easily. In addition, when compared to SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings, PaaS falls short as it doesn’t represent a complete product in the way that SaaS does. So, a company still needs to put in development effort to design, create, and test programs before they are deployed for the end users.</p>
