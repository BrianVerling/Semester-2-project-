              <h2>About:</h2>
              <p>Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor.The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management and offers guaranteed Quality of Service.CaaS allows businesses to selectively deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed basis. This approach eliminates the large capital investment and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand.</p>
              
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <center>Storage:The first is that you are able to get a great deal of storage space, much more than you may be able to get if you were using a client program for your emails. Currently, Gmail for business offers 25Gb of storage space which means that it is possible to store a large number of email messages or messages containing large files rather than being limited by storage space on a corporate server or hard drive.</center>
            <center>Accesibility:One that comes instantly to mind is the fact that it can be accessed anywhere where there is internet access. On a server based email client program you may find that it becomes difficult to access email. Some people find that when they access an online version of their messages they lack the ability to work with them as easily as if they had accessed them from their regular computer.</center>  
            <center>Cost:Gmail is low cost, zero maintenance, and data storage in the cloud, which means your email, documents, and events are always available anywhere you can get online with a web browser. You do not need an IT system administrator to create accounts and give users access to services you can do that all yourself using Google Apps dashboard.. At any time you can choose to switch to another provider and take your domain name with you, which means you do not have to change your email address if you decide Google Apps is not working for you.</center>
            <center>Security:Your business Gmail account is backed up on the Google platform which gives it guarantee of service and uptime. You access your data over a secured SSL-encrypted connection so no one can access your info</center>
