              <h3>About:</h3>
              <p>Software as a service is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet e.g Salesforce. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support</p>
             
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <p>Flexible Payments: Rather than purchasing software to install, or additional hardware to support it, customers subscribe to a SaaS offering. Generally, they pay for this service on a monthly basis using a pay-as-you-go model.</p>
              <p>Scalable Usage: Cloud services like SaaS offer high scalability, which gives customers the option to access more, or fewer, services or features on-demand.</p>
              <p>Automatic Updates: Rather than purchasing new software, customers can rely on a SaaS provider to automatically perform updates and patch management. This further reduces the burden on in-house IT staff.</p>
              <p>Accesibility: Since SaaS applications are delivered over the Internet, users can access them from any Internet-enabled device and location.</p>
