              <h2>About:</h2>
              <p>Sales as a service is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet e.g Salesforce. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support</p>
             
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <p>Flexible Payments: Rather than purchasing software to install, or additional hardware to support it, customers subscribe to a SaaS offering. Generally, they pay for this service on a monthly basis using a pay-as-you-go model.</p>
              <p>Scalable Usage: Cloud services like SaaS offer high scalability, which gives customers the option to access more, or fewer, services or features on-demand.</p>
              <p>Automatic Updates: Rather than purchasing new software, customers can rely on a SaaS provider to automatically perform updates and patch management. This further reduces the burden on in-house IT staff.</p>
              <p>Accesibility: Since SaaS applications are delivered over the Internet, users can access them from any Internet-enabled device and location.</p>
               
               <h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
               <p>Security: As data is stored on cloud, security becomes a major issue.</p>
               <p>Dependency on Internet: Relying on an Internet connection means that data is transferred to and from a SaaS firm at Internet speeds, rather than the potentially higher speeds of a firm’s internal network.</p>

                <div class="section" id="section2"><h1 class="mainheading">Platform as a Service</h1>
                <h2>About:</h2>
                
                <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those needed for application development -- to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. </p>
                
                <h3>Benefits:</h3>
                <p>Convenience: The PaaS provider supplies much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can access anywhere via a web browser.</p>
                <p>Cost: The PaaS providers then charge for that access on a per-use basis -- a model that many enterprises prefer, as it eliminates the capital expenses they traditionally have for on-premises hardware and software.Some PaaS providers charge a flat monthly fee to access their service, as well as the apps hosted within it.</p>
                <p>Dynamic Allocaion: In today’s competitive market, IT teams need to have the flexibility to quickly test and put a new feature of an application or a new service on the market; or test these on a small section of clients before making them available to the entire world. With PaaS and cloud computing, such tasks have now become possible.</p>
                
                <h3>Drawbacks:</h3>
                <p>Security: As with other cloud computing solutions, many companies still have low confidence in the level of data security offered by PaaS. Many businesses are still skeptical about having their applications hosted by a third party, while some enterprises and government clients need to be assured of compliance with all applicable regulations concerning security, privacy, and data retention before they decide in favor of PaaS services.</p>
                <p>Limited Flexibility: PaaS solutions can’t match the flexibility of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) offerings. Unlike their IaaS counterparts, PaaS customers cannot necessarily create and delete multiple virtual machines easily. In addition, when compared to SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings, PaaS falls short as it doesn’t represent a complete product in the way that SaaS does. So, a company still needs to put in development effort to design, create, and test programs before they are deployed for the end users.</p>

                <div class="section" id="section3"> <h1 class="mainheading">Infrastructure as a Service</h1>
              <h2>About:</h2>
             
              <p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet. Quickly scale up and down with demand, and pay only for what you use.

IaaS helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. The cloud computing service provider manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software operating systems, middleware, and applications.</p>

            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <p>Cost: IaaS sidesteps the upfront expense of setting up and managing an on-site datacenter, making it an economical option for start-ups and businesses testing new ideas.</p>
            <p>Innovation: As soon as you have decided to launch a new product or initiative, the necessary computing infrastructure can be ready in minutes or hours, rather than the days or weeks and sometimes months it could take to set up internally.</p>
            <p>Business Stability: With IaaS there is no need to maintain and upgrade software and hardware or troubleshoot equipment problems. With the appropriate agreement in place, the service provider assures that your infrastructure is reliable and meets SLAs.</p>
            <p>Security: With the appropriate service agreement, a cloud service provider can provide security for your applications and data that may be better than what you can attain in house.</p>
            
            <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
            <p>Cloud vendors going out of business: Cloud computing is still a quickly changing field, and there's always the danger that a new company might go out of business or radically change its service. A sudden change in service might not be too detrimental if you were only using the application for a one-time project, but it could be disastrous if you were using it for your entire donor database.</p>
            <p>The need for reliable internet service: Finally, you will become more dependent on a good Internet connection if you rely on the cloud. As more mission-critical work is done on the Internet, organizations will need much more bandwidth and few, if any, failures in Internet connectivity. If consistent Internet access, connection speed, or bandwidth are problems for your organization, cloud solutions may not be right for you at this time</p>

                <div class="section" id="section4"><h1 class="mainheading">Communication as a Service</h1>
              <h2>About:</h2>
              <p>Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor.The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management and offers guaranteed Quality of Service.CaaS allows businesses to selectively deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed basis. This approach eliminates the large capital investment and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand.</p>
              
            <h3>Benefits:</h3>
            <center>Storage:The first is that you are able to get a great deal of storage space, much more than you may be able to get if you were using a client program for your emails. Currently, Gmail for business offers 25Gb of storage space which means that it is possible to store a large number of email messages or messages containing large files rather than being limited by storage space on a corporate server or hard drive.</center>
            <center>Accesibility:One that comes instantly to mind is the fact that it can be accessed anywhere where there is internet access. On a server based email client program you may find that it becomes difficult to access email. Some people find that when they access an online version of their messages they lack the ability to work with them as easily as if they had accessed them from their regular computer.</center>  
            <center>Cost:Gmail is low cost, zero maintenance, and data storage in the cloud, which means your email, documents, and events are always available anywhere you can get online with a web browser. You do not need an IT system administrator to create accounts and give users access to services you can do that all yourself using Google Apps dashboard.. At any time you can choose to switch to another provider and take your domain name with you, which means you do not have to change your email address if you decide Google Apps is not working for you.</center>
            <center>Security:Your business Gmail account is backed up on the Google platform which gives it guarantee of service and uptime. You access your data over a secured SSL-encrypted connection so no one can access your info</center>
