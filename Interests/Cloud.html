         <h3>About:</h3>
         <p style = "font-style:normal;">The term cloud services is a broad category that encompasses the myriad IT resources provided over the internet. The expression may also be used to describe professional services that support the selection, deployment and ongoing management of various cloud based resources.The first sense of cloud services covers a wide range of resources that a service provider delivers to customers via the internet, which, in this context, has broadly become known as the cloud. Characteristics of cloud services include self provisioning and elasticity that is, customers can provision services on an on-demand basis and shut them down when no longer necessary.The usage of cloud services has become closely associated with common cloud offerings, such as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). 

<p style = "font-style:normal">i)SaaS is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers over a network, typically the internet. Examples include G Suite formerly Google Apps Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce and Workday.</p>

<p style = "font-style:normal">ii)PaaS refers to the delivery of operating systems and associated services over the internet without downloads or installation. The approach lets customers create and deploy applications without having to invest in the underlying infrastructure. Examples include Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure which refers to its PaaS offering as Cloud Services and Salesforce's App Cloud.</p>

<p style = "font-style:normal">iii)IaaS involves outsourcing the equipment used to support operations, including storage, hardware, servers and networking components, all of which are made accessible over a network. Examples include Amazon Web Services, IBM Bluemix and Microsoft Azure. SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are sometimes referred to collectively as the SPI model.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <p>1)Cost: Cloud hosting enables the businesses to enjoy minimal expenditure. As everything can be done in the cloud, the local systems of the employees have very less to do with. It saves the dollars that are spent on costly devices.</p>
        <p>2)Data Centralisation: Another key benefit of cloud services is the centralized data. The information for multiple projects and different branch offices are stored in one location that can be accessed from remote places.</p>
        <p>3)Storage: Cloud is the best platform to store all your valuable information. The storage is free, limitless and forever secure, unlike your system.</p>
        <p>4)Flexibility: Cloud based services are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your needs increase it is easy to scale up your cloud capacity, drawing on the services remote servers. Likewise, if you need to scale down again, the flexibility is baked into the service. This level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors it’s not surprising that CIOs and IT Directors rank operational agility as a top driver for cloud adoption.</p>
        <p>5)Automatic software updates: The beauty of cloud computing is that the servers are off premise, out of sight and out of your hair. Suppliers take care of them for you and roll out regular software updates  including security updates so you do not have to worry about wasting time maintaining the system yourself. Leaving you free to focus on the things that matter, like growing your business.</p>
        <p>6)Security: Lost laptops are a billion dollar business problem. And potentially greater than the loss of an expensive piece of kit is the loss of the sensitive data inside it. Cloud computing gives you greater security when this happens. Because your data is stored in the cloud, you can access it no matter what happens to your machine. And you can even remotely wipe data from lost laptops so it doesn't get into the wrong hands.</p>
