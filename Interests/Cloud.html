        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <p>Cost: Cloud hosting enables the businesses to enjoy minimal expenditure. As everything can be done in the cloud, the local systems of the employees have very less to do with. It saves the dollars that are spent on costly devices.</p>
        <p>Data Centralisation: Another key benefit of cloud services is the centralized data. The information for multiple projects and different branch offices are stored in one location that can be accessed from remote places.</p>
        <p>Storage: Cloud is the best platform to store all your valuable information. The storage is free, limitless and forever secure, unlike your system.</p>
        
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <p>Network Connection:For cloud computing, an internet connection is a must to access your precious data.</p>
        <p>Security: Of course, cloud computing keeps your data secure. But for maintaining complete security, an IT consulting firmâ€™s assistance and advice is important. Else, the business can become vulnerable to hackers and threats.</p>
        <p>Lack of Support:  Cloud-based services do not always provide proper support to the customers. The vendors are not available on e-mail or phones and want the consumers to depend on FAQ and online community for support. Due to this, complete transparency is never offered.</p>
